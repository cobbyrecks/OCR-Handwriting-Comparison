## Description

The project aims to help users understand and compare the effectiveness of different OCR algorithms when it comes to recognizing handwritten text. By providing a user-friendly interface, users can easily upload images and compare the output of Pytesseract and EasyOCR algorithms side by side.

## Features

- Supports Pytesseract and EasyOCR algorithms for text recognition.
- Allows users to compare either letters or words from two uploaded images.
- Provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to upload images and view comparison results.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cobbyrecks/ocr-handwriting-comparison.git
cd OCR-Handwriting-Comparison
````

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Usage

1. Select the OCR Algorithm (Pytesseract or EasyOCR).
2. Choose the comparison mode (letters or words).
3. Upload two images containing handwritten text.
4. Click the button to create a juxtaposed collage for comparison.

Note: The two uploaded images should be of high quality and resolution to enable the OCR algorithm to detect the letters and words effectively.
